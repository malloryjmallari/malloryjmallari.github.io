        <p>My name is Alexandra Martin but I go by Alexa. I'm going to be a rising junior at Lighthouse Community Charter School which is located in Oakland and am currently 15 years old. I'm part of a family of 5 which includes myself, my two siblings, and my parents. I heard about GWC through my sister because she attended this program a couple years ago. I decided to apply because my sister recommended it to me and I wanted to explore my interest in STEM.</p>

        <p>My name is Maelani Lacandazon but I go by Mae. I am a rising senior at Leadership Public School in Hayward, CA. I am 16 years old about to be 17 on September 2nd. I play two sports which is basketball and volleyball. I am the oldest of my 4 other siblings. Things I like to do for fun is go longboarding around my neighborhood or anywhere we go to, swimming, hanging out with friends/family and traveling. I heard about the Girls Who Code program by my mom's friend who's daughter did the program last year and recommended it to me. Adding on, I also heard about this program from my advisor who gave us a list of summer programs that we can do over the summer.</p>

        <p>My name is Mallory Mallari and I am 16 years old. I am a rising senior at Oakland Charter High School, and it is located in Oakland, CA. My birthday is on September 1st and I was born in Long Beach before moving and being raised in the Bay Area. I play both basketball and volleyball and am proud to say that I am Captain of both girls basketballa nd volleyball teams at school.  I really enjoy photography, playing volleyball, hanging out with family and friends, and overall relaxing. Before starting this program I wasn't sure about what I wanted to major in college, so when I saw the flyer for the GWC program hanging on the school wall, I decided to give it a try so that I could gain perspective on what I wanted to do. I honestly really enjoyed this past summer learning how to code while making new friends.</p>
