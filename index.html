		About Me!

	<div class="text">
		<p>
		My name is Ann Smith. I am a senior in high school. Everyone can agree that I am a good student and that I like to study. My favorite subjects are chemistry and biology. I am going to enter the university because my goal is to study these subjects as well as take on computer science in future and to become a respected professional in one of the fields.
		I can say that I am a responsible and a hard-working student. Moreover, being a sociable person, I have many friends since I like to communicate with people and get to know new interesting individuals. I enjoy my time at school: it is really nice to study and the students are very friendly and ready to help. The atmosphere cannot but make me want to go there every time. I like to receive and deal with challenging tasks. I am a very enthusiastic student and I think this is a strong point of mine.
		My friends say that I am a very funny and an interesting girl with a good sense of humor. As soon as I meet new people who are happy to meet me, I feel extremely comfortable with them. I believe that friendship is one of the most important values in human life. We exchange new ideas, find many interesting things about each other and experience new things. I appreciate friendship and people who surround me. I also consider myself a very strong independent woman who doesnt need a man.

		 Tech jobs are among the fastest growing in the country, yet girls are being left behind. While interest in computer science ebbs over time, the biggest drop off happens between the ages of 13-17. Because of this, I decided to apply for the Girls Who Code program. I can honestly tell you that I Ann Smith really enjoy this program, although it can be a bit frustrating.So far at the Girls Who Code program we have worked on many projects that consists of robots to snow animation and even a text adventure game. We fist started the program by learning on a program called scratch. Soon we moved on to python and C++.
